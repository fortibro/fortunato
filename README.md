## who am i?
fortunatus is a latin word meaning happy, lucky e.t.c according to the bible st.fortunatus is mentioned by st. paul in 1 corinthians 16:17 "i was glad when stephans, fortunatus and achaicus arrived, bcoz they have supplied what was lacking from you" BUT i'm not a saint that's my considered opinion. I am just a computer programmer I activelly maintain many javascript,PHP,java and python repositories and have contributed to other repositories.
